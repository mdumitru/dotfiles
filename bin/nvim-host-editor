"""Use the neovim host as an editor.

This script behaves like a basic editor: it receives a file as argument and
blocks until editing is done, after which it successfully exists; thus it can
be set as the value of environment variables like EDITOR, GIT_EDITOR etc.

The file is opened as a new buffer in the neovim host and editing is considered
complete when that buffer is deleted.
For this reason, there can't be two or more instances of the editor editing the
same file: neovim will just bring up the existing buffer and deleting it will
cause all editor instances to exit.
